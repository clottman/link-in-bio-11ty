# link-tree-11ty

`link-tree-11ty` was built off of a starter template for the [11ty](https://11ty.io) static site generator on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com). That template was [~11ty](https://glitch.com/~11ty) which [Cassey](https://glitch.com/@cassey) made [some slight modifications to](https://glitch.com/~11ty-simple) for better running on Glitch. The primary change there was to disable browsersync syncing.
