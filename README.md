# link-tree-11ty

`link-tree-11ty` was built off of a starter template for the [11ty](https://11ty.io) static site generator on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com). That template was [~11ty](https://glitch.com/~11ty) which [Cassey](https://glitch.com/@cassey) made [some slight modifications to](https://glitch.com/~11ty-simple) for better running on Glitch. The primary change there was to disable browsersync syncing.

## What if it breaks?
The live refreshing nature of Glitch can trip up Eleventy's watch function, because your file might get saved while you're in the middle of typing. If this happens, Eleventy might not be able to recover. Click the Tools button then Logs to see the output and errors, if any. There's a 'Console' button there where if your project needs to be forced to restart, you can type in `refresh` and the enter, and your project will start over.

## Icon Credits
Icons for this project came from [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/3775424/chemical_links_connection_connections_link_scheme_molecule_network_web_icon_icon). If you don't like them, upload your own (one in each size) to `assets` (click the assets button in your file list) and update the URLs in `src/_data/siteData.json`. Once you've uploaded an asset in `assets`, click the image to see its CDN URL.
